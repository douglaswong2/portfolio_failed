<p><h4>My name is Douglas Wong. I consider myself as an amateur photographer. Taking photos with either my phone or camera always give me a very unique feelings especially landscape. I'm currently in Newbury College majoring in Computer Science.
    I sometimes go shooting to experience myself on firearms and safety. I personally do not like coding a program because I found that is very waste of time and achieve nothing. That's why I choose to focus on Photography.</h4></p>
